    I guess you probably won't read this email before going to sleep but
I am afraid I could forget to write it tomorrow. Concerning the churchs
rules - some of us find them strange and uncomfortable, this is nothing
new and the problem repeatedly strikes since ages. It probably is the
main problem of the church. If they loosen the bounds too far they may
be accused of spoiling the faithful, and if they keep the good old rules
they will be seen as cruel people who never had contact with simple
people problems. Anyways in my mind divorce is not a thing which should
be acceptable in church - people should be more responsible for their
actions.
    Going back to the discussion about the need of propagation. I think
that religion lessons are not the best source of information and just as
I said - even though I don't think it is necessary, I reckon that having
kids may make it much easier to fulfill ones life. Keeping churchs ideas
about the marriage you would not be able to have one without wanting to
have children - every sexual intercourse should potentially spawn a
child, and even if you would avoid sexual intercourse that would make
the marriage invalid. So yes, a marriage is more less equal to having
intentions of having common kids.
    From what I heard the new pope is doing a good job helping people
solve their problems in this and similar fields.

    I like writing with you, I hope it is not a burden for you.
    Good night / Good morning / Good day.
